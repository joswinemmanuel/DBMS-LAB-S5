 ● MAX – gets the maximum value in a set of values.
● SUM – calculates the sum of values. Questions:

 Create a table named student and populate the table as shown in the table. The table contains the marks of 10 students for 3 subjects(Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics).The total marks for physics and chemistry is 25.while for mathematics it is 50.The pass mark for physics and chemistry is 12 and for mathematics it is 25. A student is awarded a ‘Pass’ if he has passed all the subjects.
